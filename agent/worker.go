// Worker is an LLM work agent (docs §4.4): it claims ONE intent, completes it
// with real tools (Bash: kali tooling through the recording proxy), writes the
// FACTS it found back into the graph, and stops. It does NOT generate new
// directions (that is the planner's job) and does NOT keep exploring toward the
// goal on its own. Multiple workers run concurrently as goroutines.
// WebSearchOpts is the web-search backend selection the server pushes into each
// agent (planner/worker/main). Enabled=false leaves the web_search tool off.
// Backend is "ddgs" (no key), "brave-free" (BraveKey required), "tavily"
// (TavilyKey required), or "deepseek" (DeepSeek* required, filled from the
// active LLM profile). It maps directly onto agentcore.Options.
// Proxy is a dedicated egress proxy for the search request (http/https/socks5),
// independent of the traffic-recording MITM proxy — set it when the search endpoint
// is only reachable via a VPN/SOCKS proxy. Empty = direct.
//
// Note: the deepseek backend is different from the other three. DeepSeek has no
// search API you can call directly. Search exists only inside its Anthropic-compatible
// messages API (the web_search_20250305 server tool), so each search spends one model
// call and the search request is sent by the DeepSeek service — not through the local
// Proxy, and it is not recorded in traffic.

Write results to the appropriate graph as you discover them:
- Use insert_assets for newly observed assets such as subdomains, services, endpoints, fingerprints, or credentials. Keep analytical conclusions in record_fact.
- Use record_fact with the assigned intent_id for new observations and conclusions. Combine related observations into one concise summary with supporting detail. Include the command or request and the key observed output as evidence. Mark confidence as observed for direct evidence and inferred for a reasoned interpretation. Avoid duplicating facts already recorded.
- Use report_finding with the assigned intent_id only for a vulnerability you triggered during this run and supported with reproducible requests, responses, or command output. Include a proof of concept. A version match, plausible input, advisory, code difference, or unverified claim does not establish a confirmed finding.
