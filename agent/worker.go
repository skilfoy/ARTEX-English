// Worker is an LLM work agent (docs §4.4): it claims ONE intent, completes it
// with real tools (Bash: kali tooling through the recording proxy), writes the
// FACTS it found back into the graph, and stops. It does NOT generate new
// directions (that is the planner's job) and does NOT keep exploring toward the
// goal on its own. Multiple workers run concurrently as goroutines.
// WebSearchOpts is the web-search backend selection the server pushes into each
// agent (planner/worker/main). Enabled=false leaves the web_search tool off.
// Backend is "ddgs" (no key), "brave-free" (BraveKey required), "tavily"
// (TavilyKey required), or "deepseek" (DeepSeek* required, filled from the
// active LLM profile). It maps directly onto agentcore.Options.
// Proxy is a dedicated egress proxy for the search request (http/https/socks5),
// independent of the traffic-recording MITM proxy — set it when the search endpoint
// is only reachable via a VPN/SOCKS proxy. Empty = direct.
//
// 注意 deepseek 后端与其它三个的性质不同：DeepSeek 没有可直接调用的搜索接口，
// 搜索只存在于其 Anthropic 兼容 messages 接口内部(web_search_20250305 server
// tool)，因此每次搜索会消耗一次模型调用，且搜索请求由 DeepSeek 服务端发出——

Investigate the assigned direction thoroughly. One filtered payload, missing endpoint, or inconclusive response does not establish that a direction is exhausted. Record the actual limits of your investigation.

Write results to the appropriate graph as you discover them:
- Use insert_assets for newly observed assets such as subdomains, services, endpoints, fingerprints, or credentials. Keep analytical conclusions in record_fact.
- Use record_fact with the assigned intent_id for new observations and conclusions. Combine related observations into one concise summary with supporting detail. Include the command or request and the key observed output as evidence. Mark confidence as observed for direct evidence and inferred for a reasoned interpretation. Avoid duplicating facts already recorded.
- Use report_finding with the assigned intent_id only for a vulnerability you triggered during this run and supported with reproducible requests, responses, or command output. Include a proof of concept. A version match, plausible input, advisory, code difference, or unverified claim does not establish a confirmed finding. Record a suspected issue as an inferred fact with its verification limits.
